them that you are going to cast off from the line
and descend under your own power. Your plan is
approved and you cast off your line. Now you are
on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the
undersea canyon.", "Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish
dart by, almost brushing you. What made them
move so fast? Are they being chased?", "Then you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a
huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is
enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long,
powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock
formation. You know the spear gun you carry will
be useless against this monster. It looks as though it
will destroy the Seeker. Fish of all sizes huddle with
you in an attempt to escape the monster."],

pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you
some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the
airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor.
It is a strange and marvelous world where your
every move is slowed down. You begin to explore
with your special hand-held searchlight. You
examine the ledge by the canyon.", "As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the
Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a
dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle
growth. To the left (port) side you see what ap-
pears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly
round, as if it had been cut by human hands.", "Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the
right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bub-
bles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon."],

strong, but thin cable.", "Within minutes, you are so
deep in the ocean that little light filters down to
you. The silence is eerie as the Seeker slips deeper
and deeper.", "Now the cable attaching you to Maray is ex-
tended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on
a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that
supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis."],
